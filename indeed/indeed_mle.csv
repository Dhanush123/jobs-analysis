We’re transforming the semiconductor and electronics manufacturing industry with our AI platform that improves yield and lowers manufacturing costs at some of the largest chip makers in the world. We’re looking for machine learning engineers who are interested in implementing, improving, and scaling new and existing algorithms using open source machine learning libraries/frameworks or writing one from scratch. We look for some combination of: high creativity and productivity, depth and breadth of knowledge in the field, and the ability to implement and scale up state of the art and/or unproven algorithms. You’ll work closely with other data scientists and software engineers to implement feature engineering, data transformations, and machine learning algorithms from scripting languages to high performance code that can scale. We look for people who are self-motivated and passionate about the transformative potential of AI. This position presents an exciting and unique opportunity to design/build the product and the platform from scratch utilizing high performance machine learning algorithms, data science and the associated frameworks.

Ability to analyze the bottlenecks and create high performance code
Good understanding of CPU and memory issues in parallel computing
Job Details

This work involves building robust ML models to achieve desired accuracy on metrics of customer interest (e.g. yield, tolerance). Broken into steps, the work is roughly an equal mix of tweaking core ML algorithms for enhanced performance and creating deployment-ready software.

This role offers a unique opportunity to deploy non-trivial ML models into production and seeing the impact of those models in action at some of the world’s largest chip manufacturers. This is not a Hadoop/Spark-focused big data role but rather an ML-focused role. Our deployment environment is markedly different from typical cloud deployment with constant access for updates or bug-fixes. Roughly stated, the production requirements are closer to a self-driving robot than a cloud-integrated image recognition service.

An ideal candidate has invested time in continuous learning and implementing algorithms either using an existing framework/library or from scratch and understands failure modes of various algorithms in production. Additionally, the ideal candidate has collaborated with Data Scientists to put ML code into production.

Electronic Arts Inc. is a leading global interactive entertainment software company. EA delivers games, content and online services for Internet-connected consoles, personal computers, mobile phones and tablets.
Here in EA's Data Science group within Global Analytics and Insights, we're always looking for new members to help expand our horizon, to move our communal thought process. Responsible for everything from recommendations and personalization to evaluating the impact of marketing investments, our group exists to push boundaries, whether they are developing cutting edge statistical models and machine learning algorithms for marketing valuation or creating the latest and greatest recommendation systems to ensure that every player journey is truly their own.

This is a team that's as likely to collaborate with game designers and producers as they are data engineers, so versatility, persistence, entrepreneurship, and passion are keys to becoming a successful contributor. We exist in a world where tasks and measures aren't easily defined by product managers or scrums and where a project’s cadence can have defined deadlines or be as vague as knowing a game's possible launch date years in the future, so our data scientists and machine learning engineers must have strong organizational skills. The biggest and single most important aspect that we look for in aspiring colleagues is intellectual curiosity, people who love the joy of discovery, in ending the day knowing a little bit more than when they woke up.

Team-members manage projects in a collaborative, group environment, giving every person an opportunity to lead, and the projects themselves are owned from conception to design, through development and all the way into implementation. Our scope of work ranges from NLP to Recommendation Engines, Statistical Theory to AI, and the variety of responsibilities for our colleagues is equally dynamic: one colleague may bias more towards research, staying in the abstract, while another may prefer to get their hands dirty, building optimization systems directly into game-clients.

We look for PhDs (minimum masters degree) in fields such as computer science, mathematics and the hard sciences, or quantitatively based degrees in social fields, such as quant marketing, sociology, and economics. To be effective, members must have experience interacting with big data stores, wrangling complex data sets, and setting up data processing workflows. All candidates must be accomplished in a modern open source data science languages such as R or Python, while machine learning engineer oriented candidates must also have strong experience in system languages such as Java or C++. More data science-oriented candidates are expected to have good understandings of statistical theory, distributions, experimental design, multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and how computational algorithms work. Titles are dependent on the applicant; we look for team-members with all levels of experience.

Gaming is changing. Over the next few years, that change is going to accelerate and without the proper knowledge and toolsets, many developers will struggle to keep up with it. Our job on this team is to ensure that we not only keep pace but become the drivers of that evolution, to help EA lead into the future. We are excited to be a part of this and hope you will be, too.

What’s in it for you? Glad you asked!

We love to brag about our great perks like comprehensive health and benefit packages, tuition reimbursement, 401k company match and, of course, many other perks! And since we realize it takes world-class people to make world-class games, we offer competitive compensation packages and a culture that thrives off of creativity and individuality.

Machine Learning Engineer,"$150,000 a yearPit.AI Technologies is taking on one of the most exciting challenges of our time, namely solving intelligence, in one of the most competitive industries ever, investment management!
The team enjoys the duality of solving humongous research and engineering problems, while remaining focused on very concrete shorter-term breakthroughs. We believe in excellence, humility, trust and inclusion, and every team member has a veto power on who we hire.
We adopt a finance-first approach to machine learning research, and we do not indulge in blindly applying solutions to machine learning problems in other domains to finance. Core to our research philosophy is the need to place as little assumptions on how the world behaves as possible, but rather let the data speak for itself, and use mathematical rigor to understand what the data is truly saying.
We are backed by Y Combinator, legendary Renaissance Technologies and First Round Capital co-founder Howard Morgan, and prominent tech VCs David Lee & Zal Bilimoria, to name but a few.

Pit.AI Technologies is hiring a Machine Learning Engineer. You'll be at the core of our effort to solve intelligence for investment management, and as such, you'll work very closely with the CEO/CTO to improve our current generation of AI-Quants.

You'll be expected to be the gatekeeper to our production machine learning code base. As such, you will be required to demonstrate strong software engineering skills, as well as the ability to both understand and implement novel machine learning methodological contributions (e.g. latest JMLR/NIPS/ICML/AISTATS/UAI articles) related to probability theory, stochastic analysis, functional analysis and optimization.

Machine Learning Engineer,"$90,000 - $140,000 a yearWe are looking for machine learning engineers to help us build an automated backoffice. In traditional banks, back offices are filled with humans. Their job usually is to verify physical documents (like government issued IDs, proof of address, proof of income documents etc), fill out forms, and search for people on google (no joke) and other sites.

Instead of using people, we want to use machines to do these things. Here is our reasoning behind this: If we can automate the back office, then we won't have costs associated with customers like traditional banks. We would be able to offer state of the art finance products to everyone at a low cost, regardless of their bank balance. (Usually banks charge monthly management fees to people with lower bank balance, aka people with lower socioeconomic status - we want to break that cycle).

Check this out: https://medium.com/synapsefi/insto-instant-account-opening-a2aac88bc0dd. Everything here uses machine learning, from instant government ID verification, to video authentication to social media verification. These are the kind of tools you will be building.

Key Qualifications:
Experience with Python, with strong love for writing tests
Experience with Tensorflow, PyTorch, Numpy
Experience with working on computer vision or NLP problems
Ability to write clean, reliable code that can be easily maintained
Ability to solve problems and identify areas of improvement
Along with Python, we use flask to build APIs, docker to containerize them, rancher to deploy and orchestrate, AWS to host, CircleCI to test (and obviously Github in between all this). So experience with this stack is a plus, but not a necessity. These things are easy to learn.
